# Name of project is-
# Encryption and Decryption of Text By Using Caesar Cipher.
This project based in cyber security. 
Offered By Exposys Data Labs Pvt. Ltd.

# Technology used: 
Java.

# Description: 
Develop Caesar Cipher method using any programming language.

# Role: 
Encrypt the word ‘Software’ by shifting 3 alphabets, then the
Caesar chipper for it will be ‘VRIWZDUH.’ So, you can start by building a Software Interface to
break such simple encryption; later on, you can move on to complex concepts. Your software
interface should have a space for the input text, and drop option to choose the ‘Shift,’ and a space
for the output text, which will be the cipher decoded text.
